## NES Emulator
  An NES emulator written in C++.

## Motivation
  In a previous course i had to build an IJVM emulator, which I enjoyed alot. While I wanted to learn more about computer architechture, i still wanted to keep it fun. Emulating the NES allowed me to do all of that. 

## Project Status

This project is in development. Currently working on implementing the PPU.
